RFID Based Access Control System - High level abstraction

This repository contains the resources used to implement a RFID Based Access Control System as a part of academic seminar by Automation and Energy systems chair of Saarland University.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that, unlike barcode, does not require line of sight and thus 
is widely applied in various areas such as vehicle tracking, library services, logistics, supply chain management, museums, 
animal detection, retail, medical etc for security, asset tracking, inventory detection and access control. 
The main objective of this paper is to design a high-level abstraction of a RFID based secured door locking system which allows only
a verified person to enter into a secured space. The implemented centralized system performs activation, authentication of passive RFID tags and enables secure check-in and 
check-out of the user after successful authentication and validation. Passive tags are used as they are small and cost less.
